### Surviving In The Boiling Isles
#### The Goal Of The Mod/Modpack

In this mod, several new glyphs are introduced. This includes both canon and entirely custom glyphs/glyph combos. The goal of the mod? Collect all of them! This mod/modpack is meant to be a calming experience of sorts early on, with things such as dungeons or the like being saved for later on down the line.

#### Where to start?

Once you enter the Boiling Isles, a quest will auto-complete, allowing you to access official documentation in the form of patchouli integration/an old journal. It is highly suggested that you read through some basic chapters of the journal, though is not required.

Simpler glyphs, such as the Ice, Fire, Plant, and Light glyphs, will be easier to obtain at any point in a given playthrough. However, glyphs/glyph combos such as 'safe hover' and 'mist' will be more difficult to come across.

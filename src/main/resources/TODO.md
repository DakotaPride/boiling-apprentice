### Implementing Systems
#### Natural Progression System

Refer to ![The Base Progression Guide](https://github.com/DakotaPride/boiling-apprentice/blob/master/src/main/java/net/dakotapride/boilingwitch/progressionDraft/PROGRESSION.md) provided, though some information is changed, which will be covered here in this file.

Even though most of the 'early-game' is already planned out, there are some things that have changed in development.

##### Ruined Letters
Now, instead of finding Boiled Notes in naturally generating vanilla structures, you will find Ruined Letters in exclusively Abandoned Fool's Blood Digsites, small areas that have been slightly excavated in an attempt to uncover Fool's blood, a key ingredient to creating an early source of Titan's blood in this pack.

These Ruined Letters will also have some occasional information on them (as a tooltip) that may help you uncover glyph recipes and useful elements to progress further. However, in the context of the pack, REI will be present. This means that glyph recipes hidden in the standard version of the mod, will be accessible via REI.

Ruined Letters will, however, also be used to create Boiled Letters (which basically replace Boiled Notes), which have been transferred to a later point in progression.

##### Abandoned Fool's Blood Digsite
As mentioned prior, these structures are key to the progression of this mod, as there are many items that are exclusive to this structure. This includes Ruined Letters, Exposed Aberrant Stone, Tinted Echo Shards, Galdorstone Shards, as well as a few other items.

##### Exposed Aberrant Stone
Exposed Aberrant Stone can be polished and refined to create regular Aberrant Stone, which is an ingredient needed to create the rift between realms.

##### Tinted Echo Shards
Tinted Echo Shards can be crafted, but only after one has reached the Demon Realm. Before this, they can only be found in the Abandoned Fool's Blood Digsites. Early on, they are used to create a Fractured Core.

##### Fractured Core
A Fractured Core is used as the main ingredient in creating a Humoured Portal-Case. This can only be used twice, but can be improved to eventually have infinite uses. (this feature is controlled via config, meaning that in the standard version of the mod, the feature will be disabled. However, in the modpack, the feature will be enabled)

##### Galdorstones/Galdorstone Shards
Galderstone Shards are used briefly in the creation of several variations of a Portal-Case. They can also be crafted into full Galdorstones later on in the progression.

##### Interdimensional Rifts
Occasionally, Interdimensional Rifts will generate in these digsites. They function as permanent portals between realms, however, they cannot move from place to place, unlike the portals created by the player.
